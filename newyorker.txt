Haefeli4) What percentage of the characters were both non-white and female?a. 1.38%5) Key Findingsa. One thing’s for sure, New Yorker cartoons are not diverse. I did not expect this from the New Yorker, especially since the publication is not shy about its liberal perspective. Besides the women, the number of nonwhite males was also dismally low at 3.92%. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I also found that white men appear in 66.63% of the cartoons. I also found that women also don’t talk often in cartoons, speaking only 9.28% of the time. Men, meanwhile, talk more than twice as often at 20.66%. This is pretty alarming to me, as it suggests that sexism is still deeply entrenched in society, even in cartoons. I’ll give more thought to cartoons going forward.
